# Recursion
## Aim:
To study recursion and implement in c++.
## Theory:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. To find the factorial of a number using recursion, the function repeatedly calls itself by reducing the number until it reaches the base case.
A function can call itself to fix smaller instances of the same problem, which is a powerful programming technique known as recursion. Recursion is a technique used in C++ when an issue can be divided into smaller, more manageable subproblems of the same kind that can all be resolved with the same function.

### Key Components of Recursion:
1. Base Case:
The condition needed for ending the recurrence. The function would call itself endlessly in the absence of a base case, resulting in infinite recursion.
2. Recursive Case:
The part of the function where it calls within itself to address a more manageable issue.

### How Recursion Works:
When a recursive function is called, the following happens: In the point where it executes the recursive call, the function pauses. It makes a new call to the same function but with different (usually smaller) arguments. Every paused call takes resume where it left off when the base case is satisfied, and the function provides a result.

## Output:
